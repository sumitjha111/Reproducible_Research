Load packages needed for this project
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
Load the activity.csv file
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
The activity date field is in the factor format and needs to be converted to date format.
activity$date<-as.Date(activity$date)
Prepare the data
actMeltDate <- melt(activity, id.vars="date", measure.vars="steps", na.rm=FALSE)
actCastDate <- dcast(actMeltDate, date ~ variable, sum)
What is the mean total number of steps per day?
Function 1 Calculate the total number of steps per day
head(actCastDate)
Function 2 Create a histogram of step count
plot(actCastDate$date, actCastDate$steps, type="h", main="Histogram of Daily Steps", xlab="Date", ylab="Steps per Day", col="blue", lwd=8)
abline(h=mean(actCastDate$steps, na.rm=TRUE), col="red", lwd=2)
Function 3 Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.
Mean
paste("Mean Steps per Day =", mean(actCastDate$steps, na.rm=TRUE))
Median
paste("Median Steps per Day =", median(actCastDate$steps, na.rm=TRUE))
What is the average daily activity pattern?
Function 1: Make a time series plot (i.e. type ="1") of the 5-minute interval (x=axis) and the
average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis).
create daily mean
actMeltInt <- melt(activity, id.vars="interval", measure.vars="steps", na.rm=TRUE)
actCastInt <- dcast(actMeltInt, interval ~ variable, mean)
Plot the mean graph
plot(actCastInt$interval, actCastInt$steps, type="l", main="Frequency of Steps Taken at Each Interval", xlab="Interval ID", ylab="Steps", col="orange", lwd=2)
abline(h=mean(actCastInt$steps, na.rm=TRUE), col="red", lwd=2)
Function 2: Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains
the maximum number of steps?
paste("Interval with max value =", actCastInt$interval[which(actCastInt$steps == max(actCastInt$steps))])
paste("Maximum interval mean steps =", max(actCastInt$steps))
Imputing Missing Values
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA).
The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.
Function 1: Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total
number of rows with NAs).
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
Function 2: Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The
strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for
that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
stepsPerInt <- actCastInt
actNoNA <- activity
Function 3: Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing
data filled in.

actMerge = merge(actNoNA, stepsPerInt, by="interval", suffixes=c(".act", ".spi"))
naIndex = which(is.na(actNoNA$steps))
actNoNA[naIndex,"steps"] = actMerge[naIndex,"steps.spi"]
Function 4: Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate
and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values
differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact
of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with
the filled-in missing values for this part.
for (i in 1:nrow(actNoNA)) {
        if (weekdays(actNoNA$date[i]) == "Saturday" | weekdays(actNoNA$date[i]) == "Sunday") {
                actNoNA$dayOfWeek[i] = "weekend"
        } else {
                actNoNA$dayOfWeek[i] = "weekday"
        }
}
Function 1: Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday”
and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
actWeekday <- subset(actNoNA, dayOfWeek=="weekday")
actWeekend <- subset(actNoNA, dayOfWeek=="weekend")
Process the data
actMeltWeekday <- melt(actWeekday, id.vars="interval", measure.vars="steps")
actMeltWeekend <- melt(actWeekend, id.vars="interval", measure.vars="steps")
actCastWeekday <- dcast(actMeltWeekday, interval ~ variable, mean)
actCastWeekend <- dcast(actMeltWeekend, interval ~ variable, mean)
Function 2:Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the
5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all
weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to
see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
plot1 <- qplot(actCastWeekday$interval, actCastWeekday$steps, geom="line", data=actCastWeekday, type="bar", main="Steps by Interval - Weekday", xlab="Interval ID", ylab="Number of Steps")
plot2 <- qplot(actCastWeekend$interval, actCastWeekend$steps, geom="line", data=actCastWeekend, type="bar", main="Steps by Interval - Weekend", xlab="Interval ID", ylab="Number of Steps")
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, nrow=2)
